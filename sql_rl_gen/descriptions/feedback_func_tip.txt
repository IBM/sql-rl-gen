You can use sql_query_execution_feedback function to return a Dictionary of [str: float], which look like this:
{
    "accuracy": float, # -1 if there is an error
    "precision": float, # -1 if there is an error
    "recall": float, # -1 if there is an error
    "f1": float, # -1 if there is an error
    "iou": float, # -1 if there is an error
    "error_type": str # can be not present if execution doesn't throw an error
    "error_reason": str # can be not present if execution doesn't throw an error
}
You can use the missed_key_words function to give different reward depending on the generated query and the ground truth or you can write your own "missed_key_words_custom" function and call it instead.
